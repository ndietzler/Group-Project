# Group-Project

This folder contains your submission for the [group project challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/b/challenges/project). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the purpose of your application? #####
> This project's purpose is to allow a variety of users to explore the world's music. Clicking on a country pulls up the top 10 trending artists also born from that selected country. This also pulls up a pie chart of music genre distribution in the country. Once an artist is clicked, the user has access to the artist's trending music on Spotify, a link to the artist's biography, and trending news articles about the artist.

The map is the focal point for larger screens and acts as an engaging visual means to interact with the data from both the Spotify and Echonest APIs. On mobile, a dropdown menu of all the countries in the world replaces the functionality of clicking on the map.

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> The people on our team are: Jason, Isabella, Natasha, Marisa

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> Sending 24,000 requests to the Echonest's server to get the pie chart data was pretty extensive. Took about 6 hours to complete.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Easily over 50 hours.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> We enjoyed the open-endedness of this assignment and how it challenged us to go beyond our limits to actively find solutions to our problems.

##### 6. Other Notes... #####
> Using Echonest's API was a bit uncertain in some spots because we are relying on the quality and accuracy of their API in terms of pulling the right music for the right artists. We ran into issues such as outdated information and certain links not working. We decided these were factors out of our control and did what we could to work around these issues. We are focusing on the functionality of our project and assume most of the information in every country is there and correct.
